# DataStructure
A small airport, with low traffic, needs to maintain landings and takeoffs.

# Airport Simulation

This Python project simulates the queue system at a small airport. The airport manages planes requesting to land or take off, and it prioritizes emergency landings.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## How to Use
Run the `Airport.py` script to simulate random requests for landing and takeoff. Emergency landings will be processed first if they are in the queue.

## Running the Simulation
To run the simulation:
```bash
python airport_simulation.py
